          <h4>Life</h4>
          <p>Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician who is widely considered today to be the father of both
            theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He was born on June 23, 1912 in London and raised
            in southern England.</p>
          <p>After graduating from King's College in Cambridge with Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees in
            mathematics, Turing earned his PhD from Princeton University in the mathematics department.</p>
          <p>During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, the British Government Code and Cypher School's
            wartime station, on a team of cryptologists with a mission of decripting German ciphers. Here, he created
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe">bombe</a>, an electromechanical computing device, with
            which his team was able to decipher German Enigma encrypted signals. After the war, Turing designed the
            Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), which was one of the first deisgns for a stored-program computer. These
            are just a couple examples of Turing's many contributions to the field of computer science and artificial
            intelligence.</p>
          <p>For a brief time, Turing was engaged to Joan Clarke, a close friend and colleague whom he met while they
            worked together at Bletchley Park. However, the two ultimately never married.</p>
          <p>Turing was gay in a time and place wherein homosexuality was illegal. In 1952, he was prosecuted for having
            engaged in homosexual acts. He was given a choice of hormone therapy (also known as chemical castration) or
            prison, and he chose the former so that he could continue his work. The multitude of negative effects on his
            wellbeing caused by the hormone therapy ultimately led to his suicide. He died on June 7, 1954, at just 41
            years old.</p>
          <h4>Legacy</h4>
          <p>Turing's honor and recognition mostly came after his death, because much of his work was kept secret by the
            British government under the Official Secrets Act. However, after his death, his incredible contributions
            came to light.</p>
          <p>Since 1966, the Association for Computing Machinery has awarded the Turing Award (commonly referred to as
            the Nobel Prize of computing), which is considered the highest distinction in computer science, and is
            awarded for significant contributions in the field of computer science.</p>
          <p>In 2013, Turing received a posthumous royal pardon from the late Queen Elizabeth II. In 2016, the British
            government introduced "Turing's Law", which automatically pardoned thousands of homosexual men, both living
            and deceased, who had been convicted of crimes based on their homosexuality alone (who otherwise would be
            innocent of any crime) during the time that it had been criminalized.</p>
          <p>Many universities across the globe have named buildings, programs, and laboratories in Turing's honor.
            Several statues of Turing exist to this day, including one at Bletchley Park.</p>
          <p>In 2019, the Bank of England announced that Turing himself, as well as images of his work, would appear on
            the United Kingdom's new £50 note.</p>
          <p>In more ways than can be listed here, Turing has been honored not only for his groundbreaking and vast
            contributions to the field of computer science, but also for the impact his life and death have had on the
            LGBTQ+ community.</p>
