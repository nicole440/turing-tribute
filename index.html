        <h4>Life</h4>
          <p>Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician who is widely considered today to be the father of both theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He was born on June 23, 1912 in London and raised in southern England.
          </p>
          <p>After graduating from King's College in Cambridge with Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees in mathematics, Turing earned his PhD from Princeton University in the mathematics department.
          </p>
          <p>During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, the Government Code and Cypher School's wartime station, with a team of cryptologists with a mission of decripting German ciphers. Here, he created the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe">bombe</a>, an electromechanical computing device with which his team was able to decipher German Enigma encrypted signals.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
        <h4>Legacy</h4>
          <p>
            A statue of Turing exists at Bletchley Park.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013, Turing received a posthumous royal pardon from the late Queen Elizabeth II. In 2016, the British government introduced "Turing's Law", which automatically pardoned thousands of homosexual men, both living and deceased, who had been convicted of crimes based on their homosexuality alone (who otherwise would be innocent of any crime) during the time that it had been criminalized.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019, the Bank of England announced that Turing himself, as well as images of his work, would appear on the United Kingdom's new £50 note.
